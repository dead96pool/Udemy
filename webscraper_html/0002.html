   CHAPTER TWO
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Howard Cole placed his glass of Willamette valley pinot noir on the desk next to the computer and looked around the expensively furnished home office to clear his mind. As was his
   <br/>
   nightly custom, he powered up his computer to check his email. He grinned slightly as he recalled his session with Krissy the previous week. He thought briefly about how much more
   <br/>
   interesting his life had become in the years since he had discovered organized BDSM and later, the internet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Life certainly has its surprises," he said before taking a sip from the one glass of wine he allowed himself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While he waited for the computer to complete the logon and download procedure, he recalled the unlikely chain of events that led to his unusual lifestyle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   From his elegant home in a heavily forested suburb of Seattle, Cole reached out into the shadowy world of those who searched for satisfaction via the internet. His occupation as a
   <br/>
   patent broker allowed him ample time to pursue his true love, the sexual domination of women.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He enjoyed being his own boss and was usually able to set his own hours. His clients were major universities and small research companies that needed to sell their patented ideas
   <br/>
   to various industries. They usually met with him at his office in Bellevue where he shared a receptionist and secretarial staff with four other businessmen. None of them had the
   <br/>
   slightest understanding of his unusual sexual tastes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the businessmen in his circle of friends brought their wives or girlfriends to business related functions. Cole usually showed up alone, which caused some speculation that
   <br/>
   he might be gay. In reality, he simply did not want to mix his sex life with his work, for obvious reasons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He remembered that on the rare occasions when he brought a woman friend, his colleagues and their wives would spend the next few days trying to figure out what gave the woman such
   <br/>
   a mysterious air of sexuality. Ill equipped to understand sexual submissiveness, they usually decided it was something mundane, like her clothing or perfume.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had no idea what a strange direction his life would take when he graduated from a Southern California law school in his late twenties with a profound distrust of the adversarial
   <br/>
   legal system. During his final year of school, he interned at a law firm specializing in criminal defense and other trial work. The things he saw there convinced him that he could
   <br/>
   never participate in the courtroom games that his classmates loved. That was also when his wife announced that he wasn't the kind of man she wanted to be married to and demanded a
   <br/>
   divorce. Shortly thereafter, he discovered a talent for patent law and never looked back. According to his estimate, he could retire at age fifty and live very nicely for the rest
   <br/>
   of his life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When the monitor finally displayed the list of incoming email, he snapped back from his self analysis and quickly focused on the messages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ah, three responses tonight, he noted. They were replies to the personal ads that he had placed systematically on various websites and newsgroups. Each of his ads was slightly
   <br/>
   different, but they all contained basically the same message.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cole described himself in the ads as a professional dominant for women only. Although the ads didn't mention it, his fee was negotiable. It would usually depend on what the
   <br/>
   customer could afford. He didn't need the money, but it helped establish a very important boundary. It also created an atmosphere that allowed for some intensely hot play sessions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When he first considered this idea, he was told by his friends from the Seattle SM scene that there was no such thing as a professional male dominant, unless you wanted to dominate
   <br/>
   men, of course. It was a simple case of supply and demand in the sex industry. The conventional wisdom also said that most, if not all, submissive women were looking for a long
   <br/>
   term relationship. After some research and several experiments in advertising, he discovered that there was a small, but significant market for his services. Not enough to make a
   <br/>
   living, which he didn't need anyway, but enough to keep him busy with interesting new women.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Once he had worked out the system, there was a slow, but steady stream of women who answered his internet ads. Most of them lived too far away, didn't have the money to travel or
   <br/>
   were just too frightened to meet with a stranger for such an intimate and dangerous activity. Cole gently discouraged many others who did not meet his personal standards for
   <br/>
   physical appearance or intelligence. About two or three times a year, he would arrange to meet with a new correspondent who seemed to be a good potential customer. In the back of
   <br/>
   his mind was always the possibility that he might meet a woman who could become his permanent partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He discovered that many submissive women didn't feel like they could really give up control to a man who was going to be a major part of their lives. A professional dominant, on
   <br/>
   the other hand, could do his job and vanish. The woman could carry on safely with her normal life, keeping only the treasured memories of her submissive sexual experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the women he met were in situations that prevented them from seeking the kind of relationship they truly desired. Perhaps they were married and unable to leave. Perhaps
   <br/>
   their career or public image was at risk. Others wished to safely learn about their submissive feelings. It seemed that each woman had her own unique reason for seeking his
   <br/>
   services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He dropped out of the Seattle SM scene when he realized that he wasn't finding what he needed there. By avoiding public gatherings of the SM community, it was also less likely that
   <br/>
   his secret life would become known to his vanilla friends and colleagues.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He would still occasionally meet his kinky friends at Beyond the Edge Cafe, the unofficial meeting place of the leather community. Only a few of his most trusted scene friends knew
   <br/>
   of his second occupation and they would occasionally send him a woman who needed his services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A meeting of the local SM club had to be something special for him to attend these days. He might go if a nationally known figure was speaking. Laura Antoniou had been at the last
   <br/>
   one and Cole had enjoyed it greatly. He sat in the back and waved politely at old friends who recognized him. After the meeting, instead of joining the milling crowd of people
   <br/>
   eager to meet potential play partners, he waited only long enough for Laura to autograph a set of her books for him. Then he quietly disappeared from the room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Now, staring intently at the computer monitor, he quickly read and eliminated all three of the responses. Not my type, he sighed. He sent each of them a polite reply telling them
   <br/>
   that he was currently unavailable. Then he answered a two day old email from a previous customer who wanted to schedule another session. Their first two sessions had been in her
   <br/>
   home, but this time she was interested in being "kidnapped" and taken away to be ravished by Cole.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He quickly typed an email message:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Dear Victoria,
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I would be pleased to provide you with a kidnapping scene on Sunday the 18th. The usual rules will apply, except that this time I will not specify a fee. After you have had a few
   <br/>
   days to think about the experience, simply send me whatever amount you feel is appropriate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I will need the full details of your schedule that day. Make certain that you are available until at least 10 PM."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cole sent the message and shut down the computer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He thought about the particular fondness he had for Victoria. It wasn't just the fact that she had a very sexy, mature body. Under her too perfect exterior and snobbish attitude
   <br/>
   was a little girl who needed to be dominated. He also had a great deal of respect for her. Victoria wasn't a thrill seeking young SM player like Kristina. She was the mature female
   <br/>
   of the species, experienced and formidable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Too bad her obsession with her looks and her society lifestyle were so annoying, he thought. Still, she had responded very nicely during their sessions and he felt like there was
   <br/>
   potential for more good play. Unlike some of his customers, she didn't seem to mind marks and bruises, as long as they could be covered by her clothing. In fact, she had indicated
   <br/>
   that she would like it a lot rougher if possible. Cole grinned at the thought. *** At that moment, in the elegant ladies' room of a historic hotel in downtown Seattle, Victoria
   <br/>
   Windham-Jenkins checked her make up for the fourth time. She was forty two years old, but looked like she was thirty. "A young thirty," she said to herself as she reshaped the
   <br/>
   outline of her slightly too bright lipstick. It made her feel better after her exchange of insults with a snobbish couple in the grand dining room a few minutes earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was aware that both her mood and her behavior had been gradually deteriorating in recent weeks. I'm getting to be such a bitch, she thought, it reminds me of that weird movie I
   <br/>
   watched last week. What was that Navajo word for life-out-of-balance? Koyanisqat-something?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She tried to remember exactly how long it had been since her last session with Howard Cole. Was it four months ago or five, she wondered? Her secretary had jokingly pointed out one
   <br/>
   of Cole's internet ads last year and Victoria had since experienced two successful sessions with the professional dominant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victoria's wealthy husband had died a decade before, leaving her with a company that controlled two hundred thousand acres of prime timber land and two world class paper mills.
   <br/>
   There was more money than she could possibly spend. She still missed the old bastard, though. He was so deliciously rough and he always seemed to know when she needed it. She
   <br/>
   constantly tested him and she could still remember how his big hand would bruise her bare bottom when she pushed him too far. Actually, she thought, I could use a little bit of
   <br/>
   that right now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although she was technically the Chairman of the Board, her presence was rarely required at company headquarters. A veritable army of managers and accountants took care of things
   <br/>
   quite nicely without her. When she was not attending society functions she spent her time in the gym and at various health spas being wrapped in odd substances guaranteed to
   <br/>
   preserve one's youthful skin tone. As yet, she had avoided the plastic surgeon. It was a matter of pride, which she had in abundance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She paid a small fortune to keep a hairdresser on call at all times to maintain her elaborate bleached blonde hairstyle. She copied it from Farrah Fawcett almost twenty years ago,
   <br/>
   but she thought of it as her trademark and would never consider changing it. Looking in the mirror one last time, she admired her bright green eyes, then patted her hair and
   <br/>
   smoothed the low cut velvet gown around her womanly curves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As she left the ladies' room, she cheered herself with the thought that men were always in plentiful supply. They would compete among themselves to see who could serve her most
   <br/>
   sincerely. She remembered a recent art gallery opening, where she had counted four attractive men of various ages who swarmed around her offering flutes of champagne, crab
   <br/>
   cocktails and radishes that were carved into perfect little flowers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To intimidate the other women that night, she had worn a tight red evening dress that displayed her large breasts and narrow waist. That sexy Italian artist told me I looked like
   <br/>
   Marilyn Monroe, she recalled with a smug little smile. She remembered how she took the lucky fellow home with her that night and discarded him the next morning as if he were an
   <br/>
   empty wine bottle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her memories ended as she returned to the party and surveyed the crowd. Tonight she had her eye on a handsome young doctor. She watched him show a mouth full of perfect white teeth
   <br/>
   when he grinned at a joke. "He'll do nicely," she thought while moving in for the kill and trying unsuccessfully to suppress a shark-like grin. The result was never in doubt. They
   <br/>
   left the party early and her chauffeur drove them both to her place. The poor doctor was used and sent home by midnight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afterwards lying alone in her gigantic bed, she thought of her late husband, Eric, and wished that he was there to give her what she really needed. Fast and easy sex was better
   <br/>
   than nothing, she figured, but she could still feel a tension within her that would be impossible to describe to anyone else. She reflected briefly on her arrangement with Howard
   <br/>
   Cole and thought, I guess I do have something to look forward to, if I can just hold out till next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When Victoria awoke the next Sunday morning, she remembered that she had given the housekeeper the day off. She was alone in her very large house. It had twenty three rooms, an
   <br/>
   outdoor swimming pool that was of little use in Seattle, and a smaller house for the servants. Cole hadn't told her when she would be kidnapped, but since he had asked her where
   <br/>
   she would go and when, she expected it to happen when she left the house to have lunch at her favorite Sunday restaurant. She told her driver to take the day off, so she would be
   <br/>
   free to go out alone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a very light breakfast, she got into the shower and started to shave. She always shaved her labia and left just a little triangle of hair above. After shaving, she spent
   <br/>
   several minutes stroking herself and thinking about what might happen to her later that day. She was reasonably certain that Cole had understood her requests for rougher play. Just
   <br/>
   as she was on the verge of coming, she stopped the erotic self stimulation in order to leave herself with a nice edge. "Oooh, gotta stop now," she said to herself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Having a hair stylist on call, she normally did not wash her own hair. Unfortunately, the stylist was not available today and she resigned herself to being without her perfect
   <br/>
   hairstyle until tomorrow. It's going to get messed up anyway, she hoped. Reaching for the shampoo, she proceeded to wash her long blonde hair. It pleased her to see that she
   <br/>
   remembered how.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With her eyes tightly closed, she put her head under the shower stream and rinsed out the floral scented shampoo. Without warning, a strong arm reached past the frilly shower
   <br/>
   curtain and wrapped around her waist. She was lifted completely out of the tub and a black cloth bag was placed over her head before she could identify the intruder. She hoped it
   <br/>
   was Cole, but she wasn't expecting him for a few more hours. With her heart pounding, she said meekly, "Howard, is that you?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The intruder was in the process of pulling her arms behind her back and snapping a pair of handcuffs on her wrists. A muffled voice said simply, "Shut up, Bitch!" It didn't sound
   <br/>
   at all like Howard. She was completely terror-stricken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still damp from the shower, naked, handcuffed and shivering with fear, she was forced to walk through the house to the garage. The intruder lifted her into a vehicle that seemed to
   <br/>
   be a van of some sort and pushed her down onto the carpeted floor. He strapped her down firmly to the floor with several wide nylon straps that felt like rough seat belts, then
   <br/>
   covered her with a thick, soft quilt. She was unable to move or see, but she heard someone get into the driver's seat. Then the garage door opened and the van drove out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When her panic had subsided a bit, she called out to the driver, "Who are you, where are you taking me?" He ignored her completely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oh God, I've really been kidnapped! she thought in panic. Her corporate security department had warned her that this was a possibility and now it had happened. She felt very
   <br/>
   frightened, but at least it was warm beneath the quilt, which was apparently filled with goose down. Maybe they'll just keep me for a few days until the ransom is paid. I certainly
   <br/>
   have enough money for that, she mused.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pressure of the tight straps and the gentle rocking movement of the vehicle gradually calmed her and created a warm submissive feeling. Somehow the feeling combined with her
   <br/>
   fear and produced a subtle erotic aura. Blinded by the cloth bag and completely immobile, there wasn't much to do but relax.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a long time, the van seemed to drive into another garage and she heard the electric rumbling as the door closed. The unseen driver opened the side door of the van and
   <br/>
   released the straps. With upward pressure on her cuffed wrists behind her back, he forced her to walk into a house and down a flight of stairs. She thought she was in a basement,
   <br/>
   but it was quite warm and the floor felt like smooth varnished wood. There was a slight smell of perfume, or was it incense?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still without a word, the man pushed her face down onto a firm bed and removed the cloth bag from her head. Before she could turn to look at him, he placed a padded leather
   <br/>
   blindfold over her eyes that was held in place with a strong elastic band. She was surprised when he took a minute to comb out her damp hair and dry it with a towel. The touch of
   <br/>
   the comb felt very intimate. Damn, I'm getting turned on, she realized.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Then the handcuffs were removed and leather bindings of some sort were firmly attached around each wrist. He pulled her across the smooth floor and attached her wrists to something
   <br/>
   in front of her. A moment later, her arms were pulled straight up above her head. She was able to keep the strain off her wrists by holding a leather strap that crossed the palm of
   <br/>
   each hand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She didn't know what to expect next. The kidnapper still hadn't spoken more than three words, so she had no clue as to why she had been forced into this humiliating position.
   <br/>
   Except for the leather restraints on her wrists, she was totally naked and exposed to anything the kidnapper wished to do. She could feel that her large breasts were nicely
   <br/>
   displayed by her raised arms. She was very proud to have such attractive breasts at her age. As her ankles were fastened to the floor about two feet apart, she struggled between
   <br/>
   fear and arousal. When she thought about how her shaved cunt was now exposed, she knew that arousal was going to win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man removed her blindfold. He stood behind her so she still couldn't identify him, but she could tell that she was in a darkened room with a single spotlight shining down on
   <br/>
   her. Nearly blinded by the sudden light, she could just make out the shape of a video camera on a tripod with a red light blinking. Perhaps the kidnapper was making a tape to send
   <br/>
   with a ransom note? Who would be looking at that tape? The thought made her hold in her stomach and thrust out her chest to show off her lush figure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blindfold was suddenly replaced, but not before she had looked down at her nude body and noticed how her firm breasts were thrust forward and her nipples were as hard as little
   <br/>
   rocks. The feeling of debasement was strong and it stimulated an increasing wetness between her legs. *** The kidnapper decided to enjoy himself a bit and started slowly caressing
   <br/>
   her. No kisses, he didn't want her to feel his beard. Seeing her without her usually perfect hairstyle made her seem more than naked. The strong spotlight emphasized the
   <br/>
   fashionable paleness of her skin. Her milky white breasts were made to be offered in this position, he thought. He made sure to pinch and twist the erect pink nipples, then
   <br/>
   squeezed each breast hard several times. He lifted and dropped each one repeatedly to appreciate their resilience and weight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reaching down between her legs, he started to lightly stroke her slightly damp cunt. Hmmm, freshly shaved, he noticed. After a few minutes, he found her clitoris, which was as
   <br/>
   hard as her nipples. She jerked when he touched it, betraying its extreme sensitivity. The ankle restraints made it impossible for her to bring her legs together, granting him free
   <br/>
   access to her erotic center.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After several minutes of light touching and teasing, his semi-willing victim was nearly ready to scream from frustration. Removing his hand from between her legs, he stepped back
   <br/>
   and picked up a four foot single tailed whip that his years of practice allowed him to control perfectly. To make sure that it was properly flexible he cracked it in the air a few
   <br/>
   feet behind Victoria's back. The sound was like a small caliber gunshot. He enjoyed seeing her jump and fight against her bonds. *** The threatening snaps of the whip frightened
   <br/>
   Victoria and she began to make sexy whimpering noises as she realized that she did not have the slightest control over what was going to happen next.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a series of gentle overhand strokes, the braided nylon cracker on the end of the whip started to kiss her pale skin. Just a light snap on her shoulder blade, then a stronger
   <br/>
   one on her left ass cheek. The impacts burned like fire for thirty seconds, then left a hot glow behind. Very light strokes alternated with moderate ones for several minutes,
   <br/>
   leaving distinct red welts on her upper back, buttocks and thighs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was a slow, regular rhythm to her punishment that added to her arousal and her desire to surrender herself to her captor. Every ten to fifteen strokes, the whip would crack
   <br/>
   near her helpless body with a loud report, re-igniting her fear. A few strokes began to creep around her generous hips leaving more raised red stripes there. She could feel every
   <br/>
   one of the burning welts, although she had lost count after fifty lashes. *** The thrill of dominating the normally haughty woman was making him hard and his rapid heartbeat was
   <br/>
   almost audible. "I feel so alive when I do this," he thought. There was an almost painful pressure as his cock tried to find a path for expansion. He would have to remove his jeans
   <br/>
   soon if this continued and he decided to pause for a moment to regain control. To regain his composure, he concentrated on his technical skills and carefully used a backstroke to
   <br/>
   place several lashes between her open thighs, setting fire to her already overheated labia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He walked around her, admiring her body and noticing how vulnerable she looked, blindfolded and hanging there within easy reach. I love the way this position emphasizes her
   <br/>
   hipbones and the way her breasts stand out and beg for attention, he thought. He sensed that it was time for another hard stroke, this one needed to strike an unmarked area of
   <br/>
   white skin just below her well shaped right bottom cheek. *** By this time, Victoria was sure it was Cole. He was playing her like a musical instrument. Nobody else understood her
   <br/>
   responses well enough to do that to her. Gasping between lashes, she cried out, "God, you're good Howard. I'm so horny I could die!"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pulling the blindfold off, he smiled and said, "You are such a slut, Vicky."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am not a slut!"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yes you are. Look how wet you get when you're tied and whipped. I'm not stopping until you admit it. Admit that you're a horny little tramp who needs to be dominated."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He adjusted the overhead rope to pull her wrists higher, forcing her up onto her toes. The harsh restraints stretched her voluptuous frame to its limits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She turned her head to get a glimpse of Cole standing behind her. The handsome face with its sinister beard and the studious glasses reminded her of how hot she was for the man.
   <br/>
   The pressure of her arms against the side of her head told her that her damp hair was nearly dry and must look horrible. It was bad enough being put on display in such a lewd
   <br/>
   manner, but she shuddered with humiliation at the thought of being seen without her usual perfect hairstyle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cole didn't mind a bit. He thought that her nicely stretched body looked quite delicious, especially when forcibly stripped of its artificial decoration. He moved around in front
   <br/>
   of her and carefully aimed the thin whip at her right breast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "No! Please... not my tits!"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She moaned and watched fearfully as the tip burned a red line into the inner curve of her sexy cleavage. She tried to shake her chest from side to side to spoil his aim, but he
   <br/>
   slowly covered her thrust out bosom with one stinging welt after another. The delightful jiggling of her breasts only spurred him on. He saved her engorged, sensitive nipples for
   <br/>
   last.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was biting her lip to keep from saying the one humiliating thing that would make him stop, when she realized that he was taking aim at her highly aroused left nipple. She was a
   <br/>
   strong willed woman, but her eyes opened wide when the whip lashed her helpless teat. Almost instantly, before the pain could arrive at her brain, he had done the same to her other
   <br/>
   nipple. Throwing her head back she let out a long scream that echoed off the walls of the large room. Hanging there whimpering as the pain in her breasts slowly diminished, she
   <br/>
   said, "You're right, Howard, I am a slut. I need to be fucked so bad I can't stand it another second."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So, you're a horny little slut, are you? You'll have to beg me to fuck you. Do you want it that bad, Little Vicki Slut?" He slid three fingers inside her while using his other
   <br/>
   hand to lightly brush her abused nipples.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victoria sucked in a huge breath as she felt her vaginal muscles relax and invite the invading fingers deeper. A large quantity of her slick fluid flowed onto Cole's hand. She was
   <br/>
   terribly embarrassed by her obvious need, but it didn't stop her from begging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yes, please sir, I really need it now! Fuck me, please fuck me!" Victoria had never felt so degraded and debased. *** Cole lowered her until he could unfasten her wrist and ankle
   <br/>
   restraints from their attachment points. Then with the leather cuffs still on, he led her to a low bed in the corner. "Get on your knees slut, you're going to be fucked like an
   <br/>
   animal. Get your head down all the way. Arch your back. Stick that cunt out for me." He reached beneath her with one hand to roughly fondle her large breasts, which were hanging
   <br/>
   straight down in a tantalizing way. His other hand slapped her welted ass and stroked her cunt to bring her arousal to a peak. He quickly removed his clothing and touched his
   <br/>
   aching cock, which confirmed his extreme horniness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cole slipped a thin textured condom onto his thick organ and knelt behind her. The view of her hips and cunt was intoxicating. He slipped easily into her wet opening and began long
   <br/>
   slow thrusts that gradually increased in speed and power. He always used a condom with his paying customers, partly to protect himself and partly to help delay his own orgasm. He
   <br/>
   was glad for the reduced sensation this time, since he had become highly aroused by dominating the proud Victoria. *** Being fucked from behind was Victoria's favorite position,
   <br/>
   but she never allowed her lovers to take her that way. She thought it was demeaning and didn't want them to see her like that. Being ruthlessly whipped, then fucked doggy style by
   <br/>
   someone who really knew how to use her was something from her hottest and most secret fantasy. Her skin was still burning from nearly a hundred thin welts, when the pounding of
   <br/>
   Cole's cock pushed her over the edge. She came in a long series of violent internal spasms and a guttural scream that sounded as if she were dying. *** Cole was breathing heavily,
   <br/>
   not from the physical exertion, but from the intense concentration. He was just a bit disappointed when she collapsed forward onto her face. "Humph!" he muttered. "You're not
   <br/>
   getting off that easily Miss Vicky."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She seemed completely incapacitated as he rolled her over onto her back. He quickly fastened the wrist cuffs to the head of the bed and used soft ropes to pull her ankle cuffs to
   <br/>
   each side, leaving her cunt gaping and ready for his attention. When she opened her eyes he saw her look at his face, then at his hard cock. He felt the wave of total lust that she
   <br/>
   projected. It was obvious. Even though their relationship was strictly limited, at that moment she wanted him inside her more than any man she had ever known.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Please, please, I need more!" she begged, while trying to thrust her wanting pussy toward him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Warming up on a nearby chair was an electric massager with a large flat head heated to several degrees above body temperature. Grasping the cylindrical handle, Cole turned it on
   <br/>
   and began to slide the warm, flat, vibrating surface up and down the slippery length of her shaved vulva. He varied the pressure in time with the movement of her hips creating a
   <br/>
   symphony of sexual stimulation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Straining against her soft bonds and panting like she had just run a marathon, Victoria had two or three more earth shattering orgasms before Cole decided to give her his own cock
   <br/>
   again. He released her legs, then held them up together while he knelt and pushed himself fully into her warm depths. Her legs folded conveniently over his shoulder. The extra
   <br/>
   tightness caused by holding her legs together helped offset the effect of the condom and the soaking wet cunt. Seeing her hands still restrained above her head reminded him that he
   <br/>
   was in complete control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He looked down at her breasts, which had flattened considerably in this position, but now jiggled dramatically with his thrusting. "Nice tits, my little slut, you should see how
   <br/>
   they bounce when I fuck you like this," he said in a humiliating tone. Victoria tried to respond verbally, but could only manage a series of gasps and grunts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The physical and emotional stimulation soon had him on the verge of coming and he slapped her welted ass with his hand just as he started to spurt. Even though Victoria was
   <br/>
   exhausted, Cole's loud groan of pleasure and strenuous thrusting forced her to come once more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly an hour later, when they had both recovered enough to talk, he inspected her for any cuts or bleeding. She was covered with thin welts about four inches long. Fortunately,
   <br/>
   none of the welts had broken the skin and they were all in areas that would heal nicely. "You'd better stay away from the health spa for a while. There's no way you're going to
   <br/>
   explain this," he said. "You won't be showing any cleavage either," he noted, while looking at her striped breasts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I know, but it was worth it. I feel so relaxed, so balanced, it's almost like being high. I can survive the rat race for another few months now. Thanks, Howard... really."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She grinned and pulled him into a lover's hug. "Don't you worry about me, I'll heal up OK."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He showed her that the video camera had been a fake. It was all part of the performance. She took some time attempting to make her hair look better, then asked for a scarf to cover
   <br/>
   it. He drove her home and handed her the garage door opener that he had used to gain entrance to her house. When she asked how he got it, he simply grinned and said, "A pro-Dom
   <br/>
   can't tell all his secrets."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victoria turned to watch him drive away. In many ways she wanted him for her own, but she knew that it was best to keep their relationship just as it was. Turning to go inside, she
   <br/>
   started to think of her next social obligation, a party that she was hosting in a week. Her newfound state of relaxation allowed her to contemplate her duties without the tension
   <br/>
   that had been present the day before.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A few days later Cole received a letter from Victoria addressed in her excellent handwriting. Inside he found a personal check for two thousand dollars and a one word note that
   <br/>
   said "Thanks."
