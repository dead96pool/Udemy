   CHAPTER FIVE
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sometime during the night, Monica awakened from a heavy, dreamless sleep to make a trip to the adjoining bathroom. "Did all that really happen?" she asked herself. She felt a
   <br/>
   pleasant soreness in various areas of her body. It was proof that her memories were real and she displayed a huge satisfied smile as she walked quietly through the bedroom.
   <br/>
   Climbing back into the large bed, she snuggled up against her new master and returned to her deep sleep feeling warm, safe and complete.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours later, Cole gradually regained consciousness as bright sunlight poured through the large window, rendering sleep impossible. Before he opened his eyes, the small portion of
   <br/>
   his brain that was working at this hour tried to analyze several things that seemed unusual. For one thing, he was curled up on his right side spoon fashion with a naked woman. He
   <br/>
   immediately remembered Monica and opened one eye. The sight of her delightful dark brown curls confirmed his guess. Most women would pay big money for a perm like that, he thought,
   <br/>
   but Monica claimed it was her natural look.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Closing his eye again, he considered going back to sleep, but he realized that he could barely feel his right arm. Apparently it was under Monica and had been there a long time. He
   <br/>
   tried to reach up and feel her breast, but the hand was too numb. Not being able to feel a breast was serious! Feeling somewhat alarmed, he opened both eyes and began the process
   <br/>
   of extricating his arm from beneath his soft and warm new lover. It wouldn't do to wake her yet, so he maneuvered very carefully. Eventually the arm came free and he was rewarded
   <br/>
   with a painful tingling sensation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sitting on the edge of the bed cradling his right arm, Cole realized what else was wrong this morning. Looking out the window, he saw through the trees a large expanse of blue sky.
   <br/>
   Whoever was in charge of the weather had obviously forgotten that this was Seattle in November. No problem, just a surprise. Is it simply El Nino or is it a good omen? he wondered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As he waited for his arm to recover, he thought about how his relationship with Monica was developing. Was she his slave? Lover? Playpartner? Maybe it didn't matter right now. He
   <br/>
   decided that the best thing to do was to just allow the relationship to develop naturally, without applying a label. His stomach reminded him that breakfast was more important
   <br/>
   right now anyway, so he pulled on a T-shirt and jeans before going down the hall to the kitchen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monica awoke suddenly to the smell of coffee and a slight hint of onions frying. "Where am I?" she wondered, "and why do I feel so good?" Then she remembered. Her dream of finding
   <br/>
   someone to be her dominant sex partner was apparently being fulfilled. Stretching luxuriously in the comfortable bed, she wondered if Cole had found her acceptable, since he wasn't
   <br/>
   here right now. Was he making breakfast for himself?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Visions of last night's events flashed through her mind. She gently caressed her buttocks to check for any damage. There was a slight tenderness that she found stimulating, but
   <br/>
   nothing disturbed the smooth surface of the skin. She grinned widely as she realized that this was certainly the most exciting thing that had ever happened to this little subby
   <br/>
   girl from Idaho. She was proud of herself for finding a safe partner who could give her what she needed. She now trusted Howard completely. There would be no question in her mind
   <br/>
   when he asked for her obedience. She longed to give it to him as a gift.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Going into the bathroom, she performed her morning necessities including a quick shower. She twisted her long hair into a pretty ponytail and looked around for something to wear.
   <br/>
   In the closet, His closet, she found a pair of men's dark blue flannel pajamas. She put them on and they felt oddly appropriate. With a slight feeling of apprehension, she walked
   <br/>
   toward the kitchen to see what kind of mood her master was in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cole turned away from the stove, where he had just finished preparing a frying pan of cottage potatoes with onions and various spices. He noticed Monica standing in the doorway
   <br/>
   wearing a pair of his flannel pajamas. She looked like a model from a slick lingerie catalog, demonstrating the latest cozy fashions for winter sleepwear.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Master? Is it OK if I wear this?" she said as she assumed a seductive pose in the kitchen doorway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He allowed himself to stare at her and a broad grin stretched itself across his face. She was devastating, even at this hour. It was nine o'clock on Saturday morning. They had
   <br/>
   played so intensely the night before that they were asleep before ten PM. Nothing like ten hours of sleep to put one in a good mood, he thought. Did Monica look this good every
   <br/>
   morning?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course you can wear it, Little One. What a good choice! You're beautiful this morning."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He placed the steaming potatoes on the table next to a bowl containing hot eggs scrambled with a hint of mustard. Stepping forward, he offered her a wineglass filled with excellent
   <br/>
   orange juice. "Will you join me for breakfast my dear?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She accepted with a smile and sparkling eyes. Over breakfast they discussed the latest issues that had developed in their relationship. Love was obviously starting to blossom.
   <br/>
   Unfortunately, an intense D/S relationship prevented many activities and conversations that were important to the healthy growth of a relationship. Cole understood it a little
   <br/>
   better than she did, but as he explained his thoughts, she quickly realized that they had to make some new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two logical minds hard at work, it only took an hour to lay the groundwork for their mutual agreement. Their first point was to keep the rules flexible. They decided that they
   <br/>
   would not maintain their master/slave roles all the time, only when they were both in the mood. Serious play sessions could be planned in advance, but due to their hot chemistry,
   <br/>
   spontaneous play would be inevitable and they agreed to enjoy it whenever it happened. They would also schedule non-kinky activities just like vanilla couples did. She enjoyed
   <br/>
   watching foreign art films, so he agreed to go along. He enjoyed shooting, which she reluctantly agreed to try.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monica made it a point to tell him that their paddle play had been nowhere near her limit. Next time, she wanted to play harder, if it pleased her master.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cole brought up the fact that they were not using condoms and needed to be very careful if they had any sexual contact with others.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monica was thinking farther ahead. "Howard, did I tell you what a big turn-on it is for me to be the partner of a pro-dom?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yes, I think you mentioned it," he said, wondering where this was leading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Well, I'd like you to keep doing it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was obviously surprised, "You would? Wouldn't you be jealous?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Maybe, but I bet we can work something out," she said with a husky, lustful voice. "You know how the erotic SM stories often have a woman who helps the dominant male? I've always
   <br/>
   thought that would be a fun role to play. Does that sound like something you'd be willing to consider?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hmmm, you mean the girl who gives the beautiful captive victim a bath and dresses her in a sexy silk gown?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yes, that's exactly what I mean!" her eyes were wide, " I think that's so hot! What do you think?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Well, if I had an assistant, she'd have to be submissive and extremely beautiful. I'd want her to have dark brown eyes and a great body. Do you know anyone like that?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their conversation dissolved in swirl of laughter and hugs. Once again they had found something they had in common.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To celebrate their success, they moved to the bedroom intent on simple vanilla lovemaking. To their surprise, their chemistry was too strong and they each fell into their dominant
   <br/>
   and submissive roles automatically. Cole wrestled her into position for a nice sexy spanking, pulling down the flannel pajamas. He noticed that her bottom was completely unmarked,
   <br/>
   which seemed a little strange after last nights paddling. Attempting to rectify the situation, he proceeded to give her a good hand spanking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monica started her sexy pre-orgasmic breathing after only a minute of delicious hand impacts on her soft, yet firm, ass. When they could stand the building sexual tension no
   <br/>
   longer, they paused a few seconds to strip, then leaped back onto the bed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She found herself on her back, looking up at Cole, kneeling between her legs and sporting a huge erection. He quickly slid both his arms under her knees and brought his hands up to
   <br/>
   her wrists. Then, gripping her wrists and pinioning her hands next to her shoulders, he held her legs open with his arms. He looked down on her pretty shaved cunt and allowed his
   <br/>
   demanding cock to pause at her greedy orifice. Her eyes widened as he began to penetrate her sensitive vaginal passage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He forced himself to take his time. She was very tight, so he paused halfway in and bent down to kiss and nibble her breasts for a minute. Slowly filling her with his manhood, he
   <br/>
   barraged her with sexual commands. "Serve your Master now slut." "Shove your cunt forward for me, my little sex toy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When her lubrication was just right, he started thrusting faster. "Tell me what you need to come now, you little strumpet."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Just keep fucking me like that Master!"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She came quickly and violently, with strong pelvic thrusts and it was all he could do to hold her down. When she was finished he said, "Hold still for me now Little One". With her
   <br/>
   wrists still locked in his grip and her legs held wide open, she held still obediently while he took his pleasure. She looked up at him with a feeling of satisfaction. Not because
   <br/>
   of her own intense orgasm, but because she had given her master pleasure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When they were able to speak rationally, they decided that they would each attend to their own business and meet again that night for a movie downtown. They were both feeling sated
   <br/>
   at the moment and agreed that their next play session would be in a week. Cole explained to her that he used the basement photo studio as a dungeon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You have a basement? Can I scream down there?" she asked.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course, my little pain slut, the neighbors will never hear a thing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Oh God, I can hardly wait. I love to scream, but I'm always afraid that someone might hear me."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He wouldn't show it to her now as he wanted it to be a surprise when she returned later for a heavy play session. They were so excited, it was hard for them to part. With a quick
   <br/>
   hug and kiss, she drove off in the direction of her home near downtown.
   <br/>
